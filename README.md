## Project's Aim
The project aims to offer an easy to use strategic tool that helps people with
dreams and goals to lead their lives with aim and purpose and achieve them too
through seeing a holistic overview about their strategy and going down into
the nitty-gritty details of each goal and breaking it down into a
manageable and measured objectives that can be broken down into
objective milestones and then into tasks.

The implementation of this project is inspired by the strategic BSC Framework,
where it can help the user to view different perspectives of the strategy
and aim for long-term success.
